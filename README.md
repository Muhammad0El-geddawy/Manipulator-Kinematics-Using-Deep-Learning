# Inverse Kinematics on RRR Robot Arm Using Deep Learning Techniques

This repository contains the implementation of inverse kinematics on an RRR (Revolute-Revolute-Revolute) robot arm using deep learning techniques. The project involves various tasks and achievements, including data preprocessing, simscape multibody model construction, data extraction pipeline, and deep learning model training. 

## Simscape Multibody Model Construction
A simscape multibody model was constructed to accurately represent the RRR robot arm and its kinematic properties. This model provided a realistic simulation environment for testing, training, and evaluating the inverse kinematics algorithm. It allowed for comprehensive analysis and validation of the model's performance before deployment on the physical robot arm.

## Data Extraction Pipeline
To capture the necessary pose data of the end effector and joint angles, a data extraction pipeline was developed. This pipeline efficiently recorded the robot arm's movements, collecting the required training dataset for the deep learning model. The pipeline ensured accurate and reliable data acquisition, enabling the model to learn the relationship between end effector poses and corresponding joint angles.

## Data Preprocessing
Prior to training the deep learning model, the collected data underwent a preprocessing stage. This involved cleaning and transforming the raw data into a format suitable for training. Steps such as normalization, scaling, and feature engineering were applied to ensure the data's quality, compatibility, and optimal performance during training. 

## Deep Learning Model Training
Deep learning techniques, specifically an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) regression model, were utilized to solve the inverse kinematics problem. The model was trained on the preprocessed data to learn the mapping between the desired end effector pose and the corresponding joint angles. Extensive training and optimization iterations were conducted to ensure the model's accuracy and robustness in solving the inverse kinematics problem for the RRR robot arm.

This repository provides a comprehensive solution for implementing inverse kinematics on an RRR robot arm using deep learning techniques. The trained model enables precise control of the robot arm's position based on desired end effector poses. It serves as a valuable resource for researchers, roboticists, and enthusiasts interested in exploring and implementing inverse kinematics algorithms in robotic systems.
